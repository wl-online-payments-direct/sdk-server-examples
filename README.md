# onlinepayments-server-sdk-examples

This is a monorepo that includes examples from the Online Payments Server SDKs that illustrates the usage of the Online Payments platform. The main goal is to bring the Server SDKs closer to the consumers by simply providing examples for their usage in every supported language.

## Getting started
